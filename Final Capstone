Task management system implemented using Python. It allows users to register, add tasks, view tasks, generate reports, display statistics, and exit the program. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code imports necessary modules, including `os` for file operations and `datetime` for date and time handling.

2. There is a constant `DATETIME_STRING_FORMAT` representing the format of the date and time used in the program.

3. The `reg_user()` function allows users to register by entering a new username and password. The entered data is stored in the `username_password` dictionary and written to a file called `user.txt`.

4. The `add_task()` function lets users add a new task. Users enter the assigned username, task title, description, and due date. The entered task details are stored in the `task_list` and written to a file called `tasks.txt`.

5. The `load_tasks()` function loads tasks from the `tasks.txt` file and populates the `task_list` with the task data.

6. The `view_all()` function displays all the tasks in the `task_list` with their details, including title, assigned username, description, due date, assigned date, and completion status.

7. The `view_mine()` function displays tasks assigned to the currently logged-in user. Users enter their username, and the function filters and displays relevant tasks. Users can mark tasks as complete or edit task details.

8. The `edit_task()` function allows users to edit task details such as title, description, and due date.

9. The `complete_task()` function marks a task as complete.

10. The `generate_reports()` function generates task and user reports based on the task data in `task_list`. The reports include information such as the total number of tasks, completed tasks, incomplete tasks, overdue tasks, and percentages. The reports are written to `task_overview.txt` and `user_overview.txt` files.

11. The code checks if the `user.txt` file exists and creates it with a default admin user if it doesn't exist. It reads the user data from the file and stores it in the `username_password` dictionary.

12. The code prompts users to enter their username and password to log in. If the entered credentials are correct, the user is considered logged in.

13. The `task_list` is initialized as an empty list, and the `load_tasks()` function is called to populate it with task data from the `tasks.txt` file.

14. The code enters a menu loop where users can select various options such as registering a user, adding a task, viewing tasks, generating reports, displaying statistics, or exiting the program. Depending on the selected option, the corresponding function is called.

15. The program continues to loop until the user selects the exit option.

Overall, the code provides a task management system with features like user registration, task creation, viewing tasks, generating reports, and displaying statistics.
